Dear Nodetime Customer,

Nodetime shut down on August 31, 2015. Our journey with Node.js continues with an enhanced [Node.js monitoring solution from AppDynamics][adnode].

It has truly been an honor to be such an integral member of the Node.js community since we originally launched in 2010. With cutting-edge features such as CPU and Heap Profiling, Nodetime has helped customers all over the world with critical insights into the health of their Node.js applications.  As I mentioned during our [acquisition by AppDynamics][aad], we’ve been given the opportunity to innovate further, leverage the core AppDynamics monitoring infrastructure, and take the Node.js management to an entirely new and unparalleled level.

Best Wishes,

Dmitri Melikyan

Principal Engineer, AppDynamics Node.js Teamdf
